# Human Pose Estimation Project

## Overview
This project focuses on developing an efficient and robust human pose estimation system. By leveraging advanced deep learning techniques, the system aims to accurately detect and track human body poses in real-time, even in challenging environments. Applications of this project include sports analytics, healthcare monitoring, rehabilitation, and security surveillance.

## Features
- **Real-Time Performance**: Optimized for low-power devices and edge computing platforms.
- **Robust Pose Estimation**: Handles occlusions, motion blur, and complex backgrounds effectively.
- **Temporal Modeling**: Incorporates motion data across multiple frames for better accuracy.
- **Lightweight Models**: Designed for efficient performance on mobile and IoT devices.
- **Multimodal Data Integration**: Combines pose estimation with additional data types like audio or sensors.

## Objectives
- Develop an accurate pose estimation model for real-time applications.
- Enhance model performance in challenging conditions, such as occlusions and diverse environments.
- Optimize the system for mobile and edge devices.
- Explore the integration of pose data with other modalities for richer insights.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Using publicly available datasets like COCO, MPII, and Human3.6M.
2. **Model Selection**: Leveraging state-of-the-art models such as OpenPose, HRNet, and TensorFlow Lite.
3. **Training and Optimization**: Fine-tuning the models to enhance accuracy and reduce computational requirements.
4. **Evaluation**: Testing the model in real-world scenarios to validate its performance.
5. **Deployment**: Ensuring compatibility with edge devices and mobile platforms.
